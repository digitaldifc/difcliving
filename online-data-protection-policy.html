                    The Dubai International Financial Centre and/or its affiliates and entities (collectively “DIFC”,
                    “we”
                    or “us”) values your security and privacy. DIFC has its own Data Protection Law, DIFC Law No. 5 of
                    2020
                    (the “DP Law”), and may for certain types of personal data processing, be subject to laws from other
                    jurisdictions.</p>

                <p>As such, it is the policy of the DIFC to respect the privacy of our DIFC website services and app
                    users.
                    In accordance with DIFC DP Law and as applicable our Terms of Use, DIFC collects information about
                    you

                    as
                    through the DIFC Connect App (the “App”).</p>

                <p>This online data protection policy (the “Policy”) sets out the basis on which any information,
                    including
                    any personal data, we collect from you, or you provide to us, will be processed by DIFC. Each time
                    you
                    access or use the Website Services or provide us with information, by doing so you acknowledge the

                    accordance with the DP Law, other applicable laws and this Policy. By submitting your Personal Data
                    (including Log, Device and / or Demographic Information), we expect you to understand that such
                    transfer,
                    storing or processing in order for DIFC to perform its general administrative and regulatory
                    functions
                    is
                    necessary and will be done in a proportionate, lawful manner, including but not limited to
                    responding to
                    enquiries you raise via the App or Website Services, oversight of the business entities registered
                    in
                    DIFC’s
                    jurisdiction and maintaining contacts for future informational or promotional activities. Unless
                    otherwise
                    notified, DIFC does not ordinarily rely solely on automated decision making when processing your
                    Personal
                    Data.</p>

                <p>In order to conduct our operations or fulfil regulatory obligations, we must transfer the Personal
                    Data

                    (where
                    applicable or required) with processors in other countries, some of which may have less protective
                    privacy
                    laws than those where you reside. In all such cases, and generally for any processing operations, we
                    take
                    appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Policy. DIFC is
                    ISO
                    27001 certified and all information security policies are strictly enforced. Please see section 7

                    your

                    further
                    outlined below. We will erase or put beyond active use your Personal Data upon request, unless we
                    are
                    required to retain it in accordance with DIFC or other applicable laws or to perform agreed
                    services, in
                    which case we align with applicable principles such as purpose specification and data minimization.

                    If it is not disproportionate or prejudicial, and required beyond this policy’s notices, we’ll
                    contact

                    In response to a request for information by a competent authority or government entities if we
                    determine
                    that such disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by any applicable law,

                <p>In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information with public authorities or law
                    enforcement. For example, we may be required to provide information related to a court order or
                    where we
                    must cooperate with other supervisory authorities in handling complaints or investigations. We might
                    also
                    share information with other regulatory bodies in order to further their, or our, objectives. In any
                    scenario, we’ll satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information,
                    document
                    our decision making, and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share the information.
                </p>

                <p> We may also share information in the event of the non-payment of a monetary penalty or fine. If the
                    debt
                    remains outstanding after the specified timeframe for payment, no payment plan is in place or an
                    agreed
                    payment plan is not being adhered to, we may initiate formal proceedings to recover the full amount
                    of
                    the
                    unpaid penalty.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p> As a result, the relevant DIFC registrar or commissioner will share Personal Data with the
                    litigation and recovery specialists it instructs in order for them to identify assets and undertake
                    recovery action through the courts.

                    All sharing of Personal Data aligns to the extent possible with the DIFC Government Data Sharing
                    Policy, which is an internal DIFC policy that governs fair and lawful sharing of Personal Data

                    to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.

                    You may also request that we restrict the processing of, erase, transfer the information you gave us
                    from one organisation to another, or otherwise process your Personal Data in line with the relevant
                    articles providing for such rights set out in the DP Law or other applicable laws.

                    Any access request generally comes at no cost to you and we must respond within one month unless
                    provided otherwise by the DP Lawor other applicable laws. We may, where permissible, impose a

                    dedicated to maintaining our data protection and security policies, periodically reviewing them and
                    making sure that DIFC employees are aware of our data protection and security practices.
                    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a
                    result, DIFC cannot warrant or guarantee the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us, and
                    you do so at your own risk.

                    DIFC has established policies and procedures for securely managing information and protecting
                    Personal Data against unauthorized access. We continually assess our data privacy, information
                    management and security practices. We do this in the following ways:

                    Establishing policies and procedures for securely managing information;
                    Limiting employee access to viewing only necessary information in order to perform his or her
                    duties;
                    Protecting against unauthorized access to Personal Data by using data encryption, authentication and
                    virus detection technology, as required;
                    Requiring service providers with whom we do business to comply with relevant data privacy legal and
                    regulatory requirements;
                    Monitoring our websites through recognized online privacy and security organizations;
                    Engaging in regular third party audits of our policies and practices; and
                    Conducting background checks on employees and providing training to our employees.
                    If you have any further questions about our security and processing activities, please contact the
                    Data Protection Commissioner’s team or refer to our Terms of Use. To the extent permitted by
                    applicable law, DIFC expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other third parties
                    obtain the Personal Data you submit through fraud or otherwise where it is no fault of DIFC.</p>
